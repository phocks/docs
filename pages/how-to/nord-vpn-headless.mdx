# How to login to nordvpn on headless debian etc

Try this:

1. `nordnpn login` and follow the link and login in browser
2. Cancel the pop up to open in the Windows app
3. Copy the URL
4. Enter `nordvpn login --callback` and then paste the URL but instead of https you want to chagne it to nordvpn

Hopefully that should work and you'll be logged in.
