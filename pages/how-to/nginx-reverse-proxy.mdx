# Set up an NGINX reverse proxy host

We are in Alpine Linux, a container. Assume we have port forwarding set up on our IP address to our container and the domain DNS pointing to our IP address.

In `/etc/nginx/http.d/`

Create a file with:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name your_domain www.your_domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass app_server_address;
        include proxy_params;
    }
}
```

Replacing your domain and the app server address (including https etc).

Try a `rc-service nginx restart`.

Try getting a certificate with `certbot --nginx`

It should work, and certbot should hopefully have updated your `.conf` file.
