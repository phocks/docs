# Reach out and touch my hand

Electronic mail details can [be accessed here](https://keys.mailvelope.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=byrd.joshua@proton.me), along with a public key, useful if you want to scramble text so as not to be intercepted by the Russians in transit.

This end-to-end [PGP encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) is the preferred method of communication, but not absolutely necessary for general, non-secure stuff. Just know that the Russians may be listening!

I'll add more contact info later perhaps. Look for me elsewhere within the interconnected series of tubes maybe.
