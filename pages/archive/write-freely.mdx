# An archive of write.phocks.org

I briefly tried out [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/). I was going to migrate the instance across, but instead I'll just keep an archive here on this static page.

# Some thoughts about a small migration
*February 25, 2023*

We are still  here. I'd almost forgotten. It's the end of days for the migration of things off my Raspberry Pi 400. We are going to the new server, the Dell mini PC.

I think this WriteFreely instance will be the last of it. All services migrated after this one. I wonder how I'll do it.

Could I just copy over the files? Was it a Docker container? I don't think it was.

I might just set up a new installation on the new server and the export and import the content. That might be easiest.

I'm not sure.

We will see.

# November 22, 2022

Do we really need a heading? I'm not sure that we do. Though, I do wonder how our system will deal with the URL. We will see I suppose. It will probably just truncate the string and sluggify.

Looks like it's just going to grab the first sentence. Still, I wonder how long the sentence can be before it starts getting truncated? Not sure. Don't really have enough curiosity to test it right now.

Had a pretty good weekend. We went to see a show at the Tivoli on Saturday. Took Vada along. Small Fry Rock it was called. All ages! Bob Evans was playing and Sarah McLeod from Jebediah and Superjesus respectively. It was pretty great.

Anyway what else has been happening?

We went to the museum to see Daddy Whale.

We put up the Christmas tree early.

Twitter seems to be going down in flames. I'm horrified but can't seem to look away.

Oh yeah, I purged all my followers on my single-user Mastodon instance, trying to clear out user storage, so had to start again from the beginning. Oh well.

What else?

Introduced DuckTales to Vada.

New work week this morning. I can feel holidays getting closer!

# A monospace post (because I can)
*November 11, 2022*

Seems like you can change font, but only for the whole post. This should hopefully be rendering in a monospace font.

Not sure why I thought this would be an interesting thing to post. But anyway I'm here now so I guess I'll keep going.

While we're at it in monospace, I wonder if we can render code here...

Let's see.

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello World!";

console.log(greeting);
```

Did that work?

How about some inline code?

OK we'll see, I guess.

(Edit: It worked!!!)

See ya later friends. Until next time.

Josh.

# Trying a post on my phone
*November 10, 2022*

To see how the experience is. Dark mode support works I see, taking a cue from system settings, but only in the editor it seems. I feel like I need to get more familiar with formatting Markdown text too.

Just worked today, from home, adding some extra functionality into some of our build tools at work. Heading in again tomorrow. Hopefully it doesn't rain. I need those clear skies so I can ride my bike in and listen to the rest of my audiobook.

So I just figured out when writing you can toggle between publishing to a “draft” or publishing “live” to the blog. That's pretty helpful.

OK that should be enough for now. Catch you next time.

Josh.

# Just setting up my writefreely
*November 8, 2022*

Hi.

I'm Josh.

This is it.

This is my first post here on the blog.

We are running WriteFreely on my little Raspberry Pi 400.

More later maybe...

Oh, and I just realised #hashtags work here as well.

Nice!

Bye for now.
