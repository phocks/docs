# Disable side-channel mitigations in VMWare Player

Just putting this hear because I keep forgetting how to do it. VMWare Workstation Player will keep bugging you if you don't do this. Also it speeds things up apparently.

Add `ulm.disableMitigations="TRUE"` to the bottom of your VM's `.vmx` file using Notepad.exe or your favourite text editor.

That's it.
