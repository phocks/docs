# Enabling Enterprise Roots

If your org uses Enterprise Root Certificates you might need to change this setting in Firefox to get sites to work properly that have strict certificate policies set.

To do this type `about:config` in the address bar and then search for `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` and set it to `true`.
